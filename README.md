# EBanking
In this project, I sharpened my skills in writing clear and maintainable application logic using C#. I also learned to build REST APIs with ASP.NET, focusing on making the code more modular and independent by separating generic from specific elements. By introducing abstractions, I aimed to make the code as modular as possible, ensuring that each component's functionality remained independent of the others. Lastly, I familiarized myself with creating ASP.NET MVC Web applications and the associated techniques involved.
